# nlp-frontend
It is bascially a front end for the project.It sends  the inputted text to the backend that is, the django API and the API returns the sentiment of the text and we use javascript to make sense of the data and return the sentiment of the  text which can be **positive,negative or neutral**
## additional functionality
The data from the API can be stored locally and can be used to infer the typical mood of the user using graphical tools or any other methods , also based on the data we can predict if the user is undergoing emotional trauma or is mentaly unwell.
the graphs do not work and frontend has not been optimized ,we can add all these aadditional funtionality
